Lược dịch từ bài gốc [WHY MANUFACTURERS PURCHASE SOFTWARE](https://www.criticalmanufacturing.com/en/newsroom/blog/posts/blog/guest-post-singleton-42#.XotkGsgzaUl) của Derek Singleton đăng trên Critical Manufacturing ngày 22.08.2013.

Software Advice helps manufacturers review and compare the various manufacturing solutions on the market to determine which solution best fits their needs. To better understand what drives manufacturers to purchase software in the first place, I decided to dig into a random sample of our 2,000-plus phone interactions. Our sample ranges from manufacturing companies earning less than $5 million in annual revenue to others with more than $100 million.

In 2013, global manufacturing leaders and small manufacturers alike are in the market for new manufacturing software. Here are a few key takeaways from our research:

1. The majority of manufacturers we spoke with cited the need to improve efficiency, accuracy or organization and wanted to automate their manufacturing processes.

2. Among manufacturing software buyers that utilize manual tracking methods to record their processes, the highest number cited the need for automation to improve their effectiveness.

3. Two-fifths of software buyers were looking to replace legacy software. They wanted to do so because their current solutions were outdated or unsupported.

4. 45 percent of the manufacturers were either customer job shops, metal fabricators or industrial machinery shops.
