Erik Nelson, an accomplished IT professional, once said in the course of a conversation with me that when it comes to prioritizing IT projects there are really only two things to consider:

Should a project be done at all?
In what order will selected projects be done?
Nothing else matters. Erik offered very sage advice because all complicated prioritizing schemes eventually reduce to this. When managing a portfolio of enterprise software projects, you can use the ROI to prioritize:

Eliminate projects with a poor ROI. They are the ones that should not be done.
Prioritize the projects worth doing by ROI for maximum value to the organization.
This article describes how to estimate the ROI for cloud or off-the-shelf enterprise software projects using the risk-adjusted value method. An example illustrating the process follows.
