Facebook today offered a fantastic presentation on ReactJS, “A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.” The presenter, Christopher Chedeau from Facebook, spoke briefly about the history of JavaScript and why Facebook wrote ReactJS. If you’ve played with ReactJS and understand at least the basics of “how” to write ReactJS, this talk will explain the “why.”

ReactJS started as a JavaScript port of XHP, a version of PHP which Facebook released four years ago. XHP was principally concerned with minimizing Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS attacks are facilitated when a malicious user enters content that is intended to inflict harm on the viewer of that content. Typical attack vectors are to enter content with embedded and hidden JavaScript (the language which runs inside every web browser), and then use that embedded JavaScript to steal information or otherwise compromise the user who views the content. XHP removes the burden of scrubbing user submitted information.

But, there was a distinct problem with XHP: dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. So, a Facebook engineer negotiated with his manager to take XHP into the browser using JavaScript and was granted six months to try it. The result is ReactJS.

If you’ve been paying attention to JavaScript development for years, you’ll know that “DOM manipulation is expensive”  has become a mantra. In other words, taking your JavaScript application data and “rendering” it into a browser is a costly operation. It is surprising, therefore, that ReactJS is the first framework to take this to an obvious conclusion: optimizing for DOM manipulation leads to a fast library, and in this case, a library which enables web applications that require very little code. ReactJS works by storing the state of your application internally, and only re-rendering your content into the browser (the DOM manipulation) when the state changes. You interact with ReactJS by telling it when the state has changed and ReactJS handles all the visual changes to your application for you. This abstraction is brilliant. The implementation is similar to AngularJS which handles DOM manipulation for you through two-way data binding, but ReactJS takes things a step further because it knows when things have changed and when they have not, which makes a difference in large applications. AngularJS relies on dirty checking and a digest loop, and my own experience is that the AngularJS interface does not have the ability to be as intelligent in determining when a change to the DOM is unnecessary and skip the DOM manipulation. For large applications, I believe this will make a difference.

If you are a computer scientist this talk will be fascinating as it documents the steps to build an effective “diff-ing” algorithm that understands when the state tree has changed. Christopher showed how initial approaches had an O(n^3) algorithmic complexity. Anyone that has ever interviewed for a computer engineering position knows that this is a high cost algorithm to be avoided with anything other than tiny data sets. The presenter noted that with a large web application with 10,000 DOM nodes, this would mean diff’ing the tree would require 17 minutes on a 1 GHz CPU. As Facebook engineers worked further on ReactJS they were able to optimize the algorithm to first achieve O(n^2) complexity, a huge improvement, but then were able to achieve O(n) complexity by using a hash map of DOM elements containing unique keys. This part of the talk was a fascinating entry point into the real CS fundamentals underlying this lovely library.

Knowing the steps used to achieve this algorithmic complexity helps explain why the library has the interface it does. ReactJS relies on a “batch” step and “pruning” step when determining what to render, steps to which your application can offer hints, and understanding the algorithm behind the scenes made lightbulbs go off in my head as I finally got why it worked the way it does. There is a learning curve with ReactJS in that you typically need to marshal data back and forth between views and models which Facebook has built to handle for you ( AngularJS revolutionized this step). The API to do this in ReactJS makes more sense when you understand why it asks you to provide hints at the times it does and this talk clarified a lot for me.

In essence, the ReactJS interface is different than other js libraries which are more imperative, meaning you tell them to change the DOM directly. Jquery is like this. ReactJS is more like: here is my state, and here is how you should interpret my state and how it will change. Now, I can sit back and let ReactJS handle the expensive and complicated task of making this visible to the user in the browser.

Christopher also mentioned a very exciting framework called “Om” from David Nolan written in ClojureScript that wraps the ReactJS library. Because Om uses immutable data structures (a feature of Clojure and derivatives like ClojureScript) Om can optimize the “shouldComponentUpdate” method inside of ReactJS and provide the proper hints automatically to applications so that the ReactJS algorithm most efficiently re-renders the DOM. Implementing undo in an application like Om is trivial, as David notes, and asks that we consider how we could do this in other JS libraries. ReactJS is a solid foundation to write interesting libraries upon.

Lastly, Christopher spoke about a performance optimization technique that comes free with ReactJS. If your application uses ReactJS, you can use the integrated performance monitoring tools inside ReactJS to analyze which parts of the application are incorrectly subjecting the application to re-rendering. Simply call “perf.printWasted()” inside your application and you’ll see an analysis of places where your application wasted render cycles because ReactJS can tell if a render was called but no state changes were made. You can then hint to your application that it should not do this, improving responsiveness. I’m not aware of other frameworks that are smart enough to tell you when the code is incorrectly written and what to do about it.

ReactJS is a fantastic approach to building web applications in JavaScript. This talk teaches you the “why” which helps a lot after you have learned the “how.” It is well worth watching when the OSCON videos are posted.
