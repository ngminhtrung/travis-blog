What are you hoping to get out of this course?

Because I don't have a background in computer science, I would like to learn CS fundamental terms to strengthen my work as software engineer. 
If, like me, you sometimes count using your fingers, odds are you can count up to 5 things on one hand (using 5 fingers). But that's if you're using "unary" notation, whereby you only have a single digit (pun intended) at your disposal, a finger, which you can think of as a 1. Binary, by contrast, allows you to use two digits, 0 and 1. How high could you could on one hand (with 5 fingers) using binary? Assume that a raised finger represents a 1 and a lowered finger represents a 0.

11111 = 1 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 31
Recall that we looked at ASCII in lecture, which uses just 7 or 8 bits to represent letters of the alphabet. Read up on "Unicode," as via Google, and explain in your own words how Unicode is able to represent many more symbols than can ASCII, which is particularly helpful for written languages with many more characters than English.

ASCII uses 7 bits to represent a character -> 128 characters.  For English only, or mostly for language used Latin alphabets. 

Unicode is a superset of ASCII. There are a coupe of UTT standards, UTF-8: minimum 8 bits, UTF-16: minimum 16 bits, UTF-32: minimum and maximum 32 bits. Because of more bits to represents a characters, more characters of different languages (Chinese, Greek, Russian, Arab, etc...) could be inserted into the Unicode.

Answer is 42.
If asked by someone how much memory your computer has, odds are they're asking how much RAM your computer has. But laptops and desktops have other kinds of memory. Cite at least one and explain in your own words how it differs from RAM.

HDD (Hard Disk Driver) vs RAM: Large storage (up to few TB) vs small storage (few GB); mechanical operations vs electronic operations; permanent & non-volatile vs short-term & volatile; cheaper vs more expensive (in terms of cost/GB). 
Some computers, particularly PCs, come with stickers that say "Intel Inside." What is it that's inside of most computers that's made by Intel? In your own words, what does that hardware do?

CPU - Central Processing Unit. Computer's brain. Mainly responsible for all computing arithmetic operations. 
Roughly how much RAM might a new laptop come with these days?

About 4GB - 8GB - 16GB
Roughly how much disk space might a new laptop come with these days?

128GB - 256 GB - 512 GB - 1 TB
Name at least 3 devices that can be connected to a laptop or desktop via "USB".

mouse, keyboard, external HDD. 
Even though both are wireless, how does Wi-Fi differ from Bluetooth? You're welcome to Google as needed, but take care to distinguish the two in your own words.

Bluetooth: to connect with other devices in a close distance. Wi-Fi: to access to the internet.
A copy of your responses will be emailed to the address you provided.
