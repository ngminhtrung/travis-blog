I get asked a lot: “will you release a new edition of (a book I've written)?” Answers for every book:

Professional Ajax: No, no longer useful.

Professional JavaScript: No, but another author is signed up for the update.

High Performance JavaScript: no, JS perf changes too quickly these days.

Maintainable JavaScript: unsure, definitely not a high priority. 

Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript: YES! Highest priority when I have energy. 

Understanding ECMAScript 6: No, frozen in time...
