It depends on how much you want to regret the code you written in your first React project after a year.

I compiled a list of Awesome JavaScript Learning resources which might be able to help you.

I don’t think you need to work through the whole list and study language and Web APIs for weeks, but you need to know a few things to make React work for you.

I personally would recommend the following to get a solid understanding of the following JavaScript language concepts and APIs:

Basics including scopes, hoisting, functions as first class citizens, closures
A re-introduction to JavaScript (JS tutorial)
Understanding Hoisting in JavaScript
How to manipulate data in a functional way
Array methods
JavaScript's Map, Reduce, and Filter • Dan Martensen
Object.keys, values, entries
Pure functions
Master the JavaScript Interview: What is a Pure Function?
Handling asynchronous code
An incremental tutorial on promises in javascript
Why JavaScript’s Async/Await Blows Promises Away (Tutorial)
Asynchronously sending and receiving data
Using Fetch
Why I won’t be using Fetch API in my apps
ES6+
ES6 Modules
Let and Const
Arrow Functions
Classes
Template Literals
Spread Operator and Rest Parameters
Destructuring
The last three ES6 points are not really needed as they really are syntactic sugar. But the let you write less code to get things done. Which brings me back to beginning of my answer:

»It depends on how much you want to regret the code you written in your first React project after a year.«

The most important thing is to get started. Good luck on your journey.
