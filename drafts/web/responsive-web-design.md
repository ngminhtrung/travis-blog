### Pixel density là gì?

Pixels per inch (PPI) or pixels per centimeter (PPCM) are measurements of the pixel density (resolution) of an electronic image device, such as a computer monitor or television display, or image digitizing device such as a camera or image scanner. Horizontal and vertical density are usually the same, as most devices have square pixels, but differ on devices that have non-square pixels.

### Device Independent Pixels

The term “device-independent pixels” basically just means a unit of measurement on an image that **has nothing to do with the actual size of the display**. Let’s look at a simple example:
