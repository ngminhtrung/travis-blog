MECE Framework McKinsey
 
“**MECE**,” (phát âm là “*me see*”), viết tắt cho cụm “*mutually exclusive & collectively exhaustive*,” là một cách tư duy giải quyết vấn đề rất phổ biến ở những công ty tư vấn như McKinsey. Nó là một cách tập hợp và chia nhỏ thông tin thành những mảng (hoặc những phần tử) không có "gaps" (collectively exhaustive - CE) và không có "overlaps" (mutually exculusive - ME). Nói cách khác, nó là cách mà thông tin (bao gồm ý tưởng, topics, issues, solutions) được sắp đặt vào những “MECE buckets": các bucket không nằm chồng lấn lên nhau, mỗi item chỉ thuộc về 1 bucket mà thôi, và các bucket đã chứa tất cả các items có thể xảy ra trong context.
 
### How is it used?

Những người làm tư vấn sử dụng MECE framework (Issue Tree, Decision Tree, Hypothesis Tree) to segregate a client’s problems into logical data categories that can be analyzed systematically and minutely by their staff involved with the project. The framework is notably used at McKinsey, where data from clients’ businesses is organized on the basis of MECE. Well-known frameworks, such as Cost-Benefit Analysis, 4Cs, and Porter’s Five Forces have the MECE principle at their core.

Let’s discuss three popular MECE frameworks.
 

#### Issue tree

How is the MECE framework used to solve clients’ issues at consultancies? One method consultants use is to create an “issue tree” to arrange all the information that they have and divide this information into all possible issues and sub-issues.

An issue tree is particularly helpful for solving large and complex problems as it facilitates splitting them up into smaller, solvable problems. “Issue trees” get their names from their structure—narrow at the top with the problem statement, and wider towards the bottom, even as each level accommodates more specific sub-issues or smaller problems. However, some “trees” are also created left to write, but the principle remains the same.

A common type of cases in which a MECE issue tree is used is profitability cases. Suppose the problem statement is “My restaurant is not profitable.” An issue tree is created, starting with the problem statement at the treetop.

The various sub-levels of the tree would answer the question “How to make the restaurant profitable?” in broad, intuitive ways: “Increase revenue” and “Reduce costs.” The lower levels would also answer the question “How?”

The second level, with sub-issues of the first level, would answer the questions “How to increase revenue?” (under “Increase revenue”) on the one hand and “How to reduce costs?” on the other. The answers under “Increase revenue” would be “Increase the number of orders” and “Increase the prices of items.” The answers under “Reduce costs” would be “Reduce salary expenditure,” “Reduce rental,” and “Reduce raw material expenses.”

On the third level, the issue tree would tackle the question “How to Increase the number of orders?” One way to increase orders would be to shift the restaurant to a busier area and another would be to launch a marketing campaign so that the restaurant becomes more widely known. On the other main branch, under “reduce salary expenditure,” options such as “fire redundant workers” could be mentioned, as also “shift to a less expensive locality” under “reduce rental”, and “change the vendors,” under “reduce raw material expenses.”

How does an issue tree help? It enables consultants to consider all options separately and exclusively and suggest the best option to the client. It helps create a common understanding among team members about the problem-solving framework and focus team efforts. It smoothens work distribution among team members.

Often, consultants who create an issue tree may need to “trim branches,” which means doing away with options that are not worth pursuing after a detailed initial consideration. In the example of the issue tree, given above, about how to increase the profitability of a restaurant, increasing prices may not be an option for various reasons, and that “branch” of the issue tree may be left out or “trimmed.”

For illustrating the concept here, a simple example has been given. In real-world contexts, the problems may be much more complex. The suggested solutions would have to be backed by hard data so that they are logical and can be proven to be such.
